## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Overview

- **Genre**: Top-down base defense, monster survival
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Defend your base from escalating monster waves
  - Upgrade weapons and skills
  - Repair and reinforce your defenses
  - Face different monster types (nomal, fast, tanky, etc.)
    - **Slime** (Normal Type): These monsters exist solely to sacrifice themselves in order to weaken or destroy obstacles in their path. The demon army deploys them to corrode and dissolve enemy walls and defenses.

    - **Lizard Men** (Tracker / Fast Type): Agile and aggressive, Lizard Men excel in high-speed combat, overwhelming enemies with sheer speed and numbers. However, their lightweight build makes them fragile and vulnerable to direct attacks.

    - **Oni** (Heavy / Tank Type): Oni are powerful brutes with devastating attacks and thick, armor-like skin that grants them strong resistance to damage. Despite their strength, their large size and slow movement make them easy targets for ranged attacks, allowing defenders a chance to eliminate them before they reach the fortress.
